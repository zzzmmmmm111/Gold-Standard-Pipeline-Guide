Electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) therapy is highly effective in psychiatric diseases including depression, but also implicated beneficial effects on other neurological diseases. Although it has been reported that the neurons in the VMH are strongly activated by ECS stimulation, the effect of ECS in this hypothalamic subnucleus remains unknown. To address this issue, we investigated molecular changes in the VMH in response to ECS by utilizing a method of laser-capture microdissection coupled with microarray analysis, and examined behavioral effects of ECS via VMH activation. ECS significantly induced gene expression not only immediate-early genes such as Fos, Fosb and Jun, but also Bdnf, Adcyap1, and Hrh1 in the VMH after a single or repeated stimulus.\"\n","!Series_overall_design\t\"Mice received one or 7 times shock of ECS and their brains were collected at 2 h (VMH_1stECS2h, VMH_7thECS2h) or 6 h after shock (VMH_1stECS6h, VMH_7thECS6h). The brains of sham-treated animals were collected at 2 h after treatment(VMH_sham). The VMH was microdissected from dehydrated brain sections, and its total RNA was extracted. RNA samples from two or three animals were pooled to minimize the impact of biological variance. After nucleotide amplification by the ovation amplification, the gene expression profiles were obtained by the Affymetrix microarray analysis. The microarray analysis was performed twice using different sets of animals.\"\n","!Sample_geo_accession\t\"GSM938860\"\t\"GSM938861\"\t\"GSM938862\"\t\"GSM938863\"\t\"GSM938864\"\n","!Sample_characteristics_ch1\t\"strain: C57Bl/6\"\t\"strain: C57Bl/6\"\t\"strain: C57Bl/6\"\t\"strain: C57Bl/6\"\t\"strain: C57Bl/6\"\n","!Sample_characteristics_ch1\t\"tissue: hypothalamus\"\t\"tissue: hypothalamus\"\t\"tissue: hypothalamus\"\t\"tissue: hypothalamus\"\t\"tissue: hypothalamus\"\n","!Sample_characteristics_ch1\t\"treatment: no shock, brain collected after 2hrs\"\t\"treatment: 1 shock and brain collected after 2hrs\"\t\"treatment: 1 shock and brain collected after 6hrs\"\t\"treatment: 7 shocks and brain collected after 2hrs\"\t\"treatment: 7 shocks and brain collected after 6hrs\"\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def filter_label_info(file_path, prefixes):\n","    filtered_lines = extract_lines_with_prefix(file_path, prefixes)\n","    filtered_content = '\\n'.join(filtered_lines)\n","    clinical_data = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(filtered_content), delimiter='\\t', low_memory=False)\n","    return clinical_data\n","\n","prefixes = ['!Sample_geo_accession', '!Sample_characteristics_ch1']\n","trait_clinical_data = filter_label_info(trait_data_path, prefixes)\n","trait_clinical_data"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":161},"id":"9i-Sq8ZpSw6I","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702591423013,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Mianchen Zhang","userId":"16347720849794978946"}},"outputId":"18ff082a-9ba0-4f26-f33d-0c1c526be48e"},"execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["         !Sample_geo_accession  \\\n","0  !Sample_characteristics_ch1   \n","1  !Sample_characteristics_ch1   \n","2  !Sample_characteristics_ch1   \n","\n","                                         GSM938860  \\\n","0                                  strain: C57Bl/6   \n","1                             tissue: hypothalamus   \n","2  treatment: no shock, brain collected after 2hrs   \n","\n","                                           GSM938861  \\\n","0                                    strain: C57Bl/6   \n","1                               tissue: hypothalamus   \n","2  treatment: 1 shock and brain collected after 2hrs   \n","\n","                                           GSM938862  \\\n","0                                    strain: C57Bl/6   \n","1                               tissue: hypothalamus   \n","2  treatment: 1 shock and brain collected after 6hrs   \n","\n","                                           GSM938863  \\\n","0                                    strain: C57Bl/6   \n","1                               tissue: hypothalamus   \n","2  treatment: 7 shocks and brain collected after ...   \n","\n","                                           GSM938864  \n","0                                    strain: C57Bl/6  \n","1                               tissue: hypothalamus  \n","2  treatment: 7 shocks and brain collected after ...

In this study we aimed at evaluating gene expression changes induced by acute cocaine exposure on SH-SY5Y differentiated cells, which have been widely used as a dopaminergic neuronal model. Expression changes and a concomitant increase in neuronal activity were observed 6 hours after a 5 uM cocaine exposure, whereas no changes in gene expression nor in neuronal activity took place at 1 uM cocaine. A total of 756 differentially expressed genes, mainly related to regulation of transcription and gene expression, cell cycle, adhesion and cell projection, as well as MAPK, CREB, neurotrophin and neuregulin signaling pathways. Genes displaying altered expression were subsequently targeted with predicted functional SNPs in a case-control association study in a sample of 806 cocaine-dependent patients and 817 controls. This study highlighted associations between cocaine dependence and five SNPs predicted to alter microRNA binding at the 3â€™UTR of the NFAT5 gene. The association of SNP rs1437134 with cocaine dependence survived the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. A functional effect was confirmed for this variant by a luciferase reporter assay, with lower expression observed for the rs1437134G allele, which was more pronounced in the presence of hsa-miR-509. However, brain volumes in regions of relevance to addiction, as assessed with MRI, did not correlate with NFAT5 variation. These results suggest that the NFAT5 gene, which is up-regulated a few hours after cocaine exposure, may be involved in the genetic predisposition to cocaine dependence.\"\n","!Series_overall_design\t\"for each condition, 9 dishes containing SH-SY5Y were used.
