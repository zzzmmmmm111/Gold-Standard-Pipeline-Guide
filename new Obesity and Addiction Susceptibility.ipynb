Despite the negative impact of obesity on clinical outcome, molecular mechanisms through which excess adiposity influences breast cancer etiology are not well-defined.\"\n","!Series_summary\t\"\"\n","!Series_summary\t\"Methods: Affymetrix U133 2.0 gene expression data were generated for 405 primary breast tumors using RNA isolated from laser microdissected tissues.  Patients were classified as normal-weight (BMI<25), overweight (BMI 25-29.9) or obese (BMI>30). Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA using Partek Genomics Suite version 6.6 using a false discovery rate <0.05 to define significance.\"\n","!Series_summary\t\"\"\n","!Series_summary\t\"Results: Obese patients were significantly more likely to be diagnosed >50 years or with African American ancestry compared to lean or overweight women. Pathological characteristics, including tumor stage, size or grade, lymph node status, intrinsic subtype, and breast cancer mortality did not differ significantly between groups. No significant gene expression differences were detected by BMI In a non-stratified analysis which included all subtypes or within luminal B, HER2-enriched or basal-like subtypes. Within luminal A tumors, however, 84 probes representing 77 genes from pathways such as cell cycle, p53 and mTOR signaling, tight junctions and a number of cancer associated pathways were differentially expressed.\"\n","!Series_summary\t\"\"\n","!Series_summary\t\"Conclusions: Identification of transcriptome differences in luminal A tumors from normal-weight compared to obese women suggests that obesity alters gene expression within ER+ tumor epithelial cells.  Alterations of pathways involved in cell cycle control, tumorigenesis and metabolism may promote cellular proliferation and provide a molecular explanation for less favorable outcome of obese women with breast cancer.  Targeted treatments, such as mTOR inhibitors, may allow for improved treatment and survival of obese women, especially African American women, who are more likely to be obese and suffer outcome disparities.\"\n","!Series_overall_design\t\"Two to five serial sections (8 um thick) were cut, mounted on glass PEN foil slides (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), stained using the LCM staining kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and laser microdissected on an ASLMD laser microdissection system (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).  Slide preparation, staining and cutting were performed within a 15 minute period to preserve RNA integrity. RNA was then isolated using the RNAqueous-Micro kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and treated with DNase I to remove any contaminating genomic DNA.  RNA integrity was assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), converted to biotin-labeled aRNA using two rounds of amplification with the MessageAmpII aRNA Amplification kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and the concentration and quality of the samples was measured with the NanoDrop 1000 (NanoDrop Products, Wilmington, DE) and 2100 Bioanalyzer.  Hybridization, washing, staining and scanning of HG U133A 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were conducted according to manufacturerâ€™s protocols. The gene expression data were analyzed with PartekÂ® Genomics Suite v 6.6 (Partek Incorporated). Probe set intensities were obtained by robust multi-array average background correction, quantile normalization, median polish summarization, and log2 transformation.

In this study we aimed at evaluating gene expression changes induced by acute cocaine exposure on SH-SY5Y differentiated cells, which have been widely used as a dopaminergic neuronal model. Expression changes and a concomitant increase in neuronal activity were observed 6 hours after a 5 uM cocaine exposure, whereas no changes in gene expression nor in neuronal activity took place at 1 uM cocaine. A total of 756 differentially expressed genes, mainly related to regulation of transcription and gene expression, cell cycle, adhesion and cell projection, as well as MAPK, CREB, neurotrophin and neuregulin signaling pathways. Genes displaying altered expression were subsequently targeted with predicted functional SNPs in a case-control association study in a sample of 806 cocaine-dependent patients and 817 controls. This study highlighted associations between cocaine dependence and five SNPs predicted to alter microRNA binding at the 3â€™UTR of the NFAT5 gene. The association of SNP rs1437134 with cocaine dependence survived the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. A functional effect was confirmed for this variant by a luciferase reporter assay, with lower expression observed for the rs1437134G allele, which was more pronounced in the presence of hsa-miR-509. However, brain volumes in regions of relevance to addiction, as assessed with MRI, did not correlate with NFAT5 variation. These results suggest that the NFAT5 gene, which is up-regulated a few hours after cocaine exposure, may be involved in the genetic predisposition to cocaine dependence.\"\n","!Series_overall_design\t\"for each condition, 9 dishes containing SH-SY5Y were used.
